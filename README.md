# InteractiveNotificationiOSSampleApp
Interactive Local Notification for iOS Sample app. This sample app demonstrates 2 different type of interactive notification:
- While phone is unlocked and app is in the background, minimal context banner notification will appear from the top. Pulling down on it will display 2 options: "Take" or "Skip". Tapping on either action should present a confirmation message. However, tapping on the notification (instead of  Take/Skip) will deep-link to the app and display 3 options: Take, Skip or Postpone
- While phone is locked, minimal contextt notification will appear. Sliding from right to left will show 2 actions: Take and  Skip. Selecting one of those action will give rise to a confirmation. However selecting the notification itself (sliding left to right) will deeplink to the app and display 3 options: Take, Skip or Postpone
